                    <p>
                        A well written and well illustrated book about an Oregon cat who hosts an exchange cat from
                        Norway. Kids will love the storyline and parents will love the great lessons about the
                        importance of new friendships, travel and exploration. I wonder what is next on Powell the cats
                        agenda?

                    <p>
                        Powell, a Maine Coon cat from Oregon, hosts Bjorn, a foreign exchange cat from Norway.
                        Transitioning from an indoor kitty to an outdoor Oregon explorer, Powell takes the reader
                        through the journey of a lifetime.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two
                        kitties teach each other their customs while becoming fast friends. In the evenings, Powell and
                        Bjorn visit some of the beautiful forests in Oregon and make new friends along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only
                        will your children love hearing about the kitties' adventures, they will also learn some fun
                        facts about cats and forests.

                    <p>Welcome to powellcat.com!</p>
                    <p>We hope that you will enjoy reading Powell and the Foreign Exchange
                        Cat. Please use the Amazon link to order a
                        copy or two. We hope you will help us realize our dream of free little libraries having a copy
                        of Powell and the Foreign Exchange Cat.</p>
                    <p>Powell was adopted by Victoria in 2017, when he was 5 years old, through Meow Village. His
                        original mama unexpectedly passed away leaving Powell needing a new mama to take care of him.
                        Victoria believes that Powell rescued her right back and filled her heart with love the moment
                        she met him. Victoria now volunteers for Meow Village.</p>
